## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 or higher
-   [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) for managing dependencies (keeps your project well-groomed!)
-   Docker (optional, for containerized deployment - a comfy kennel for Newshound)
-   A Discord Bot Token (See [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yuseiito/newshound.git
    cd newshound
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using Rye:**

    ```bash
    rye sync
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

    ```
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
    DATABASE_FILE=newshound.db
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual Discord Bot Token.

4.  **(Optional) Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    rye run alembic upgrade head
    ```

    This command sets up the database schema - ensures Newshound's got a solid foundation!

### Running the Bot

**Locally:**

```bash
rye run python newshound.py
```

**With Docker:**

1.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t newshound .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name newshound-container -v newshound_data:/app -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN -e DATABASE_FILE=/app/newshound.db newshound
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual Discord Bot Token.
